Weed-Detection

This is an object detection project aming at recognising weed objects.

## Dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/vvatsalggupta/weed-detection

Two types of images are included in the dataset: (i) images of food crops and weeds that

* shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris)
* field chamomile (Matricariaperforata)
* wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus)

## There were 6 food crops selected:**
* beetroot (Beta vulgaris)
* carrot (Daucus carota var. sativus)
* zucchini (Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo)
