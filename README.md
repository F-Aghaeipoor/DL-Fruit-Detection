# Fruit Detection

This is an object detection project aiming at identifying fruit objects namely apple, bnanna, orange, pineapple, strawberry, and mango.

A part of dataset is available in https://www.kaggle.com/kanmeh/fruits-dataset?select=train_zip. Additionally, several images of the last three species were manually prepared and annotated.

Two types of images are included in the final dataset: (i) images of one single fruit (ii) images
of mixed fruits.

This project can be generalized to detect more species of fruits in case of preparing more training images.
